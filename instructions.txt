Hi there,

This is a small attempt to apply themes for waybar with ease.

!!!!!!!!!MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR EXISTING WAYBAR CONFIG!!!!!
    (YOU CAN AS WELL SAVE YOUR "config.json and style.css" in the themes folder so u can switch back to it)

--HOW-TO-----

- copy omarchy-theme-waybar script to .local/share/omarchy/bin and make it executable with chmod +x omarchy-theme-waybar

- copy the themes folder to .config/waybar/ - see !!!

- open a terminal and call the omarchy-theme-waybar or make a keybinding like ==> bindd = SUPER, Z, waybar, exec, omarchy-theme-waybar

- select the theme from the list (based of the contents in the waybar/themes folder) - do not use capital letters for future themes.

- the theme you choose should apply. if it does not use omarchy-restart-waybar or if you think you got errors waybar & disown command should tell you what is wrong. Rinse and Repeat!


What this script does is it extracts the config.json and style.css from the themes/themename folder into the waybar folder using a script that calls walker for the menu.


After appying the theme you should see in the waybar directory the following:


-config.json - your theme
-style.css - your theme
themes folder
scripts folder - if any


NO WARRANTY, IS DISTRIBUTED AS-IS. NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT !

Enjoy!
